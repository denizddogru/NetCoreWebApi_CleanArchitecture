# Clean API Development Project (

Udemy Course by Fatih Çakıroğlu , all credits to him.

## Overview
This project is an implementation of best practices in API development, following the course "ASP.NET Core API & Web - Multi-Layered Architecture API Best Practices" by Fatih Çakıroğlu on Udemy. The primary goal is to learn and apply clean architecture principles and best practices in API development using ASP.NET Core.

## Project Structure
The project evolves through various architectural stages, starting with N-Layer Architecture and progressing towards Clean Architecture. Each stage introduces new concepts and best practices in API development.

## Current Status
**Current Focus: N-Layer Architecture**

We are currently implementing and exploring the N-Layer Architecture, which serves as a foundation for more advanced architectural patterns.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Introduction**
   - Basic setup and project initialization

2. **N-Layer Architecture** *(Current Stage)*
   - Implementing separation of concerns
   - Defining clear boundaries between layers

3. **Validation**
   - Implementing robust input validation techniques

4. **Mapping**
   - Efficient data mapping between layers

5. **Exception Handling**
   - Implementing global exception handling

6. **API Development**
   - RESTful API design and implementation

7. **Best Practices**
   - Applying industry-standard best practices in API development

8. **Clean Architecture**
   - Transitioning to Clean Architecture principles

9. **Caching**
   - Implementing caching strategies for performance optimization

10. **Service Bus Integration (RabbitMQ)**
    - Implementing message queuing for scalable architecture

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement N-Layer and Clean Architecture
- Apply best practices in API development using ASP.NET Core
- Gain hands-on experience with various aspects of modern API development
- Learn to integrate advanced features like caching and message queuing
